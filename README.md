# Altosphere

## Overview
**Altosphere** is an AI-driven mapping project that leverages the power of foundation models to create high-resolution maps from aerial imagery. Inspired by Atlas, the Greek god of maps, Altosphere aims to elevate the standards of geographic mapping and provide valuable insights for urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster response.

## Features
- High-resolution mapping from aerial imagery.
- Accurate segmentation of land cover types: buildings, roads, woodlands, and water bodies.
- Utilizes state-of-the-art foundation models for enhanced performance.
- Scalable solution designed for real-world applications.

## Inspiration
With the increasing need for precision in mapping for sectors like urban development and environmental conservation, Altosphere harnesses the capabilities of AI to transform aerial data into actionable maps. 

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: We utilize the **LandCoverAI** dataset for training and testing.
2. **Model Selection**: The project employs the **Aerial_SwinB_SI** model from the **SatlasPretrain** models, fine-tuned for segmentation tasks.
3. **Training**: Built with **PyTorch Lightning** for efficient training on high-resolution aerial imagery.
4. **Output**: Generates detailed maps that can be used for various applications.

## Challenges
During the development of Altosphere, we faced several challenges, including:
- Balancing accuracy and computational efficiency.
- Fine-tuning pre-trained models without overfitting.
- Ensuring the final map outputs were accurate and scalable.

## Accomplishments
- Successfully adapted a pre-trained model to produce high-resolution maps.
- Demonstrated strong performance in land cover segmentation.
- Implemented efficient training pipelines using advanced techniques.

## What We Learned
- Deepened understanding of foundation models and their applications in earth observation.
- Gained hands-on experience with large datasets and model optimization.
- Learned the importance of scalability and usability in real-world applications.

## Future Plans
Future developments for **Altosphere** include:
- Expanding the model to cover larger geographical areas.
- Integrating the solution into real-world applications with local governments and organizations.
- Continuous improvement of model accuracy and performance.
